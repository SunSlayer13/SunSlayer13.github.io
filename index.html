  <h1 class='title'> Why The Legend of Zelda:
    Breath of the Wild, is Better Than Any Mario Game</h1>
  <h2>By Joseph Badrov</h2>

  <p>As one of the most popular video game franchises of all time, Mario has always been a fan favorite due to his engaging adventures and exciting gameplay. However, the Nintendo Switch introduced a new contender for the title of best game, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild. While both franchises offer their own unique appeals, it could be argued that Breath of the Wild is the superior game for several reasons.</p>
  <br>
  <h1> An Open-World Experience </h1>

  <p>
    Firstly, Breath of the Wild offers players a beautifully crafted open-world experience, which is something Mario has yet to achieve. Players can roam the vast and diverse landscapes of Hyrule, encountering a plethora of wildlife and monsters on their journey. Additionally, the game provides an unparalleled sense of freedom and autonomy, allowing players to approach challenges in their own way, rather than following a linear progression path.</p>
  <p>

  <h1> Story </h1>
  <p>
    Secondly, Breath of the Wild’s narrative is much more compelling and emotional than Mario’s. While Mario has always boasted a light-hearted and fun story, Breath of the Wild delves into deeper themes of loss, regret, and redemption. Players take the role of Link, a stoic hero who awakens after a 100-year slumber to a world in ruins. The game’s main objective lies in restoring Hyrule to its former glory and defeating the evil Calamity Ganon, all while uncovering the events that led to its downfall.</p>

  <h1> Game Mechanics </h1>
  <p>
    Thirdly, the game’s physics-based mechanics have taken the world by storm, proving to be both innovative and creative. Breath of the Wild introduced elements such as Sheikah runes, which can be used for abilities such as creating bombs or manipulating metal objects. These mechanics can be used to create unique solutions to puzzles or to traverse the game’s vast world, breaking away from traditional gameplay in both Mario and Zelda.</p>

  <h1> Detailing </h1>
  <p>
    Fourthly, the detail put into the game’s world, characters, and mechanics is unmatched. Breath of the Wild excels at immersing players into its world, with stunning graphics and sounds of nature creating a truly engaging experience. Hyrule is not just a backdrop but is a world full of hidden gems, secrets, and lore. Every location has its own unique history, with NPCs providing insight and depth into the stories that make up the game’s world.</p>

  <h1> Content </h1>
  <p>
    Finally, Breath of the Wild's longevity is another aspect in which the game surpasses Mario. The game boasts an incredible amount of content, with countless side quests, shrines, puzzles, and enemies to defeat. Mario games tend to be short and sweet, providing a fun experience that can be completed in a matter of hours. Breath of the Wild, on the other hand, offers an immersive experience spanning dozens of hours of gameplay, providing endless entertainment.</p>

  <h1> Conclusion </h1>
  <p>
    In conclusion, while Mario has solidified itself as a classic game franchise, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild has set new heights in terms of open-world gameplay, narrative, mechanics, immersion, and longevity. The game has received critical acclaim and has been the recipient of numerous awards, further proving its superiority over Mario. With exciting rumors of a sequel in the works, fans can only look forward to another incredible journey in the world of The Legend of Zelda.</p>
